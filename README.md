# Algorithms

This project contains following:
1. Convert the Maze into a tree
2. Find the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm.
3. Find th shortest path using Bellman Ford algorithm.

Dijkstra Algorithm: 
•	Dijkstra’s algorithm solves the single-source shortest-paths problem on a directed weighted graph G = (V, E), where all the edges are non-negative (i.e., w(u, v) ≥ 0 for each edge (u, v) Є E).

Bellman Ford Algorithm: 
•	This algorithm solves the single source shortest path problem of a directed graph G = (V, E) in which the edge weights may be negative.
